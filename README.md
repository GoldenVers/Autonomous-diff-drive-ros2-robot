# 🧠 Articubot One - ROS2 Navigation & SLAM Simulation Project

This a journey of me following the tutorial of articulated robotics to create a mobile robot. this is here is a full ROS2-based mobile robot simulation project built with blood,sweat,tears, curiosity, and late-night bug hunting.

---
 ## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project simulates a differential drive robot in a Gazebo world using ROS2 (Humble). The aim is to develop a simulated robot that can:

- Be controlled via teleoperation or mobile input.
- Use **SLAM** to build maps of unknown environments.
- Navigate using **Nav2** stack and autonomously move to goal positions.
- Simulate real-world robotics behavior through Gazebo + RViz2.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Differential drive simulation with `ros2_control` and `gazebo_ros2_control`
- ✅ SLAM using `slam_toolbox`
- ✅ Full integration with `Nav2` stack
- ✅ Twist multiplexer (`twist_mux`) for command management
- ✅ Sensor TF broadcasting (camera, lidar, wheels, etc.)
- ✅ RViz2 visualization
- ✅ URDF and SDF modeling with a clean TF tree
- ✅ Organized launch files for modularity

## 📈 Project Journey

This project WAS NOT smooth, but it was worth every challenge.

- 👨‍🏫 **Started** by building a custom robot URDF.
- 🔧 **Debugged** endless issues with `diff_drive_controller` & wheel joints.
- 📊 Used `view_frames` to troubleshoot TF conflicts.
- 🧙‍♂️ The breakthrough came after tweaking robot **inertial parameters** and **plugin tuning**.
- 💡 Realized RViz2 glitching was due to duplicated `odom` TF—*disabled it manually and voilà!* 🎉
- 🔀 Branching out via Git for every phase.
- 🧭 SLAM started mapping magic after carefully configuring the sensors and `slam_toolbox`.
- 🧩 Learned to carefully manage `twist_mux` parameters and `params.yaml` structure.
- 🧹 Cleaned up launches and got `Nav2` running with simulation time syncing.

---

## 🥳 Final Status

The robot is now successfully able to:

- Map its environment in real time.
- Navigate to a defined goal using Nav2.
- Accept multiple input commands using a multiplexer.
- Broadcast all necessary TFs without conflict.
- And all of this... without physical hardware.

## 📁 How to Run

> Make sure to build the workspace and source the overlay before launching!

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
